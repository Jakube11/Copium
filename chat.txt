.net is not working for VSCode

It is for visual studio 2022, not for vs code

you gonna work on this or wot

yea srry ive been playing minecraft 90% of the afternoon

Home.html links to "main.css" but the file doesnt exist? its in the folder but it doesnt actually exist?

I'm still confused on what this project will actually be, so i cant really build a website without the basis on what the website actually is for.

LEO - ok so baisic premise is a place for chuchlands kids to talk and gossip

So a message board? Also, you dont need to sign your messages, i can remember who said what.

If we're creating a message board, we'll need to add an authentication page, so the user that is trying to send a message doesn't do anything malicious.

We will also need a way to blacklist bots/people with malicious intent.

I'm going to install VS2022, but you'll need to teach me how to use it, as I only know how to navigate VSCode.
