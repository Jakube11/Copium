.net is not working for VSCode

It is for visual studio 2022, not for vs code

you gonna work on this or wot

yea srry ive been playing minecraft 90% of the afternoon

Home.html links to "main.css" but the file doesnt exist? its in the folder but it doesnt actually exist?

I'm still confused on what this project will actually be, so i cant really build a website without the basis on what the website actually is for.
